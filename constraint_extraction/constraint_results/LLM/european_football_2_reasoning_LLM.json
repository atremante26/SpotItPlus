        "reasoning": "The dependency TEAM_FIFA_API_ID \u2192 TEAM_LONG_NAME is meaningful as it establishes a clear relationship between a unique identifier (TEAM_FIFA_API_ID) and the corresponding team name (TEAM_LONG_NAME). Given that the mapping is 100% consistent across 299 rows, it indicates reliability. This relationship is not trivial, as TEAM_FIFA_API_ID serves as a unique identifier for teams, making it a valid candidate for a functional dependency constraint that would enhance query verification."
